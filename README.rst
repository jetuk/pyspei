pyspei is a Cython wrapper around the C version of `The Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index <http://sac.csic/spei/>`__ (SPEI) toolbox. The module provides Python accessible methods to compute SPEI using the standalone C version. The C version is distributed as part of this package and is not required separately.
